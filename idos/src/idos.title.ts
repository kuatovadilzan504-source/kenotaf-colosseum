// The project's IDENTITY file — the ONE centralized place the Title id lives.
//
// On platform-created projects the platform GENERATES this file when it creates the project; there
// the AI editor is denied write access to this path on purpose — do not edit it by hand. On a
// manually scaffolded project (get_host_scaffold / copied template) there is no generator: YOU fill
// IDOS_TITLE_ID here yourself. Either way, do not import anything into this file, and do not bind
// the title anywhere else (.env.local is a local-dev fallback for the raw template only).
//
// It is the highest-priority source of the Title id (see config.ts for the full chain). It is baked
// into the bundle rather than read from the URL because a build has to keep working where there is
// no URL to read — packaged as a mobile app, embedded in an iframe, or opened from a shared link
// that dropped its query string.
//
// It holds the CANONICAL (production) title. The DEV title is derived from it, never stored here —
// one project has one identity, and DEV/PROD is an environment on top of that identity.
